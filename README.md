## User Story 

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

--

## Acceptance Criteria 

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Description

This Horiseon website is built to show the services they can provide to other companies to help them grow! The website base was provided as a starter code, and I have worked to improve the CSS styling by making it more succinct as well as added semantic elements to the webpage and included alt text for all images.
